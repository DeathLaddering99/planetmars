/The object
I made a simple speed comparing script between an array and a dictionary for my developing humble game.

/Usage
Firstly, populate this script to a GameObject in a scene.
Then hit the play, wait the "Set up has being done" message in console.
Click the right mouse button will shoots a whole array search, on the other hand the left mouse button will do a dictionary search.
I wish you would enjoy this:) Yugata Okita 置田諭固
